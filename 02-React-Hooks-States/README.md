# State Hooks

## Instructions

### Installation

Let's get started on our installation process for our main application. We'll be using a simple "Todo List" for the next activities ahead, so start by opening the terminal and navigating over to the `/Unsolved` folder and run:

`npm install`

### Assignment Prep

#### Part 1

The install is going to take up a little time, which gives us a chance to go back and look over the React Hooks documentation once again! Very exciting! But seriously, it's for your own good...

* [React Website](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

#### Part 2

Once the install has finished, let's start the app:

`npm start`

The app should now be running on your localhost, and you should be seeing a title and input field on the page. Mess around for a minute to test the functionality of this app. While you're doing that, follow along in `App.js` to see changes being made to the state, how they're being made, and what the goals of the component really are.

* You should be testing the following functions:
  1. Adding a new task
  2. Deleting a task
  
### Assignment

Now let's do the same thing you did for the last activity:

* Replace all stateful functionality with State Hooks!

### Bonus

Add some extra functionality to these tasks in the list, using your new knowledge of State Hooks (ex. change color of task based on importance, change the order of the tasks on the DOM, etc).
  
### Hints
  
* Feel free to reference the last activity, or swing on by the React documention on Hooks again if you're feeling lost. This isn't meant to be easy/effortless right away - it's okay to ask for help, just make sure you exhaust all resources (internet included) first.
