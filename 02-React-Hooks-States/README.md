## State Hooks

## Instructions

### Installation

Let's go ahead and get started on our installation process for our main app. We'll be using this simple "Todo List" application for the next activities ahead, so we'll start by opening the console and navigating over to the 'Unsolved' folder and run:

`npm install`

### Assignment Prep

#### Part 1

The install is going to take up a little time, but that's okay because it gives us a chance to go back and look over the React Hooks documentation once again! Very exciting! But seriously, it's for your own good...

* [React Website](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

#### Part 2

Once the install has finished, let's start the app to see what we're working with:

`npm start`

The app should now be running on your localhost, and you should be seeing a title and input field on the page. Go ahead and mess around for a minute to test the functionality of this app. While you're doing that, keep looking over the `App.js` so you can follow along with the changes being made to the state, how they're being made, and what the goals of the component really are.

* You should be testing the following functions:
  1. Adding a new task
  2. Deleting a task
  
### Assignment

Now that you've gotten a good feel for the way the app is meant to work and what the App component does, we're going to do the same thing you did for the last activity:

* Replace all stateful functionality with State Hooks.
  
### Hints
  
* Feel free to reference the last activity, or swing on by the React documention on Hooks again if you're feeling lost. This isn't meant to be easy/effortless right away - it's okay to ask for help, just make sure you exhaust all resources (internet included) first.
