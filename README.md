## Introduction to Hooks

### Overview

Students should have an understanding of HTML, JavaScript, React and a base knowledge of frameworks. Prior knowledge of non-class-based state-management isn't required.

Be the end of the lesson, students should have a strong base understanding of React Hooks with regards to both states and effects, and their implementation with React applications. They'll be transforming the React application given to them, to a Hook-based React app, utilizing all of the new methods they'll be learning. We'll be focusing mainly on the two most used strategies of React Hooks - States and Effects.
